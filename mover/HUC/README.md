- Hello! I'm a second-year student with two years of experience in web development. My primary tech stack includes JavaScript and MySQL, but I'm also familiar with React, Node.js, and Express. I'm eager to learn and explore new technologies like TypeScript and GraphQL.

- I have a strong interest in blockchain technology, particularly the Move programming language. I see Move as a great entry point to explore decentralized applications and smart contracts. I'm passionate about building innovative solutions that leverage the power of blockchain.
