## Personal Introduction
- Work Experience:  `student`
- Tech Stack: `JavaScript`, `Move`, `Solidity`
> I am a final-year student majoring in software engineering. For most of my studies, I focused on Web2 developmentâ€”building RESTful APIs, working with databases, and optimizing server-side performance. But I always felt like something was missing. Web3 opened up a new way of thinking about data, ownership, and security, and when I discovered Sui, it all started to make sense.Move is different from any programming language I have worked with before, but it forces me to think carefully about how resources are managed. Right now, I am building my first DeFi project on Sui, which aims to create a lending platform with enhanced security guarantees. My ambition is to launch a startup in the Web3 space and contribute to the development of financial tools that are accessible to everyone.
