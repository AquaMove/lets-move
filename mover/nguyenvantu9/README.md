## Personal Introduction
- Work Experience: `1 year`
- Tech Stack: `C++`, `Move`, `Rust`
> Important: I come from a game development background, studying computer graphics and multiplayer systems. Blockchain was never on my radar until I started looking into in-game asset ownership. I joined a Web3 hackathon out of curiosity and got my first introduction to Move. The more I learned, the more I saw its potential for game economies. Suiâ€™s low-latency execution model and its ability to handle massive on-chain interactions efficiently make it an ideal blockchain for gaming. My goal is to develop a next-gen GameFi project, where players have full ownership over their assets and where transactions happen instantly without high fees. Right now, I am focused on improving my understanding of smart contract security to ensure my future projects are both functional and robust.
