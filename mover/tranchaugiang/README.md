## Personal Introduction
- Work Experience: `3 months`
- Tech Stack: `Java`, `Move`, `Python`
> I am a third-year computer science student with a strong interest in backend development and system architecture. My journey into blockchain started as a curiosity—something I read about but never explored deeply. That changed when I joined a Sui hackathon. Move’s unique approach to ownership and Sui’s ability to handle high transaction volumes without congestion showed me how blockchain could solve real-world problems in a way Web2 systems never could. Since then, I have been dedicating my time to learning Move, writing small smart contracts, and participating in coding challenges. The learning curve has been steep, but I enjoy the challenge. My goal is to secure an internship in the Sui ecosystem and work on real projects that contribute to the network’s growth. In the long run, I want to become a core developer specializing in blockchain infrastructure.
