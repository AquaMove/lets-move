## Personal Introduction
- Work Experience: `3 months`
- Tech Stack: `C++`, `Move`,`Rust`
> Introduction: I am currently studying computer graphics and multiplayer systems at RMIT University Vietnam. My journey into blockchain wasn’t planned—I started in game development, focusing on graphics engines and networking. But when I joined a Web3 hackathon, I saw how on-chain assets could transform game economies. Sui’s low-latency execution model and its ability to handle massive on-chain interactions efficiently make it an ideal blockchain for gaming. My goal is to develop a next-gen GameFi project, where players have full ownership over their assets and where transactions happen instantly without high fees. Right now, I am focused on improving my understanding of smart contract security to ensure my future projects are both functional and robust.
